# Working with Postman Collections

To have the postman collection automatically updated we are going to use the Postman API. The Postman API is a powerful tool that allows you to automate frequent tasks. In this case we are going to use it to update the collection with the latest changes.

How to import the collection into Postman:

Option 1. Import the collection from the URL: <LINK_PINNED_ON_DISCORD>

Option 2. Copy / Paste the content of the collection <LINK_PINNED_ON_DISCORD> into Postman.

Option 3. Copy / Paste the content of the collection <LINK_PINNED_ON_DISCORD> into a JSON file and import that JSON into Postman.
