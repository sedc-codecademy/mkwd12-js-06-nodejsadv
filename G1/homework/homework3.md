# Homework 3 - Music App with PostgresSQL

### Deadline: 28.04.2024

## Basic Requirement

This is continence of the previous homework.

To be able to complete this homework you will need to have the [previous one](https://github.com/sedc-codecademy/mkwd12-js-05-nodejs-basic/blob/main/G1/homework/homework4.md) done. If you haven't done it yet, please do it first, as connecting to a database makes sense only if we have some logic and endpoints before the connection.

### Database Connection

1. Install TypeORM package with npm like we did in class, follow the instructions in the readmes or the code example from class.
2. Create a connection to the database **you have created**.
3. Use .env file to store the elements of the connection string.
4. Use the following structure fot the .env file:
    ```env
   
    ```
5. No need to send us the .env file, just make sure you have it in your project.
6. While checking your homework we will use our own .env file to test the connection with our own database. That is why we just need the same variable names to speed up the process.
7. You are free to structure the models in the DB as you see fit.
8. Make sure all the data from the previous homework is stored in the database, it's fetched from the database and the endpoints are working as expected.

### Bonus Requirements
Same as the previous homework, but now you need to store the data in the database and fetch it from there.

## Before you send it...
* Don't forget to test your api with Postman.
* Don't forget to add a .gitignore file to your project and add /node_modules to it.
* Don't forget to send the postman collection with your homework! (instructions on how to do this in the root instructions.md file)
