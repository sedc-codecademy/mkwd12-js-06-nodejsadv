# Homework 4 - Swagger for Music App

### Deadline: 05.05.2024

## Basic Requirement

This is continence of the previous homework.

To be able to complete this homework you will need to have the [previous one](https://github.com/sedc-codecademy/mkwd12-js-06-nodejsadv/blob/main/G1/homework/homework3.md) done. If you haven't done it yet, please do it first, as connecting to a database makes sense only if we have some logic and endpoints before the connection.

1. The goal of this homework is to create a swagger documentation for the music app you have created in the previous homework.
2. Make sure you create all the necessary DTOs, and add proper validation of all properties while doing any CRUD operation.
3. Make sure you add appropriate responses for all endpoints, and make sure you add the proper status codes, descriptions, and examples for swagger docs. Each endpoint should have proper documentation of all possible responses.

## Before you send it...
* Don't forget to test your api with Postman or Swagger.
* Don't forget to add a .gitignore file to your project and add /node_modules and /dist to it.
* Postman collection in not necessary when Swagger is added, no need to send it.
