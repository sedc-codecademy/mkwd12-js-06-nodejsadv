# NestJS

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript as its primary language and draws inspiration from Angular's architecture to provide a robust and structured framework for building server-side applications.

## Platform

Nest aims to be a platform-agnostic framework. Platform independence makes it possible to create reusable logical parts that developers can take advantage of across several different types of applications.

Technically, Nest is able to work with any Node HTTP framework once an adapter is created. There are two HTTP platforms supported out-of-the-box: express and fastify. You can choose the one that best suits your needs.

Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.

## Features:

- **Modularity**: NestJS is built with modularity in mind, allowing developers to organize their code into reusable and maintainable modules.
- **Dependency Injection**: It leverages the power of dependency injection to manage the creation and sharing of application components, making it easy to write clean and testable code.
- **Middleware**: NestJS provides middleware support for intercepting and modifying incoming HTTP requests, enabling developers to implement cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and error handling.
- **Controllers and Services**: It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, with controllers handling incoming requests and services encapsulating the business logic.
- **Decorators**: NestJS makes extensive use of decorators to define routes, inject dependencies, and configure modules, simplifying the development process and promoting code readability.
- **TypeScript**: Being built with TypeScript, NestJS offers static typing, enhanced tooling, and improved maintainability, making it a great choice for large-scale projects.
