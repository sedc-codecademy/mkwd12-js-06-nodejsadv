## Complete academy management app

So far we have created a nestjs app for managing academy, subjects, students and trainers. Your task will be to continue where we stopped and finish the app.

### Requirements

- Implement student and trainer module (get the reference for the required properties from the uploaded picture we drew on the class)

  - add dto's
  - add services
  - add controllers
  - add pipes
  - implement search by query params by age on both students and trainers

- Don't forget to send the postman collection so that we can test your solution
