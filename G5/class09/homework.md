# Budget Tracker App with PostgresSQL

## Basic Requirement

This is continence of the previous homework. The idea is to transform the previous version of your homework into one that is using PostgresSQL instead of Mongo.

To be able to complete this homework you will need to have the [previous one](https://github.com/sedc-codecademy/mkwd12-js-06-nodejsadv/blob/main/G5/Class08/trip-planner/homework.md) done.

### Database Connection

1. Install TypeORM package with npm like we did in class <br>
``` npm install @nestjs/typeorm typeorm pg ```
2. Create a connection to the database **you created**.
3. You are free to structure the entities in the DB as you see fit.
8. Make sure all the data from the previous homework is stored in the database, it's fetched from the database and the endpoints are working as expected.

## Before you send it...
* Don't forget to test your api with Postman.
* Don't forget to add a .gitignore file to your project and add /node_modules to it.
* Don't forget to send the postman collection with your homework!
