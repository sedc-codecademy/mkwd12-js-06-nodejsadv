# G5 - Repository for Advanced Node.js ðŸš€

This is a subject where we will learn the advanced features of Node.js using JavaScript as programming language. In this subject the main focus would be to revise the concepts that we learned from Advanced JavaScript and Basic Node.js and explain some more complex features of the runtime environment and prepare well for the next subjects. The course will last 15 modules and will consist of new concepts as well as exercises and workshop classes in order to get one's hands on the code that is learned in class. Hope you have fun and good luck ðŸ˜‰

**On this subject you already know the basics of Node.js and you are ready for some advanced concepts and features. The focus will also be to build good programming habits and start working on problems and solutions individually. With that in mind we will learn:**

-	Introduction to Databases and ORMs
- MongoDB and Mongoose
- Typescript
- BE Frameworks â€“ Nest.js
- Nest.js - structure and consisting parts
- Documentation of APIs
- Good practices in Node.js and latest features
